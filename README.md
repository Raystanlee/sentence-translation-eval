## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook detailing our project for CSCE 598, focused on language translation using neural networks and evaluating the score using cosine similiarity. The core of the project revolves around the English-Spanish dataset and utilizes the MarianMT model and gpt-3 for sentence translation.

## Features
- **Module Installation and Library Import**: Essential libraries and modules for the project are listed and installed for seamless replication and study.
- **English-Spanish Dataset Processing**: Detailed steps on how we import, randomize, and select rows from the dataset for translation purposes.
- **Translation Using MarianMT**: Demonstrates the use of the MarianMT model to translate sentences from English to Spanish.
- **Translation Using gpt-3**: Demonstrates the use of the gpt-3 model to translate sentences from English to Spanish.
- **Embedding extraction**: Extract embedding from spanish translation for both MarianMT and gpt-3 model.
- **Cosine Similarity Score Computation** Compute the cosine similarity score between both embeddings



## Getting Started
To get started with this project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to install required libraries.
4. Run the notebook to see the translation process in action.
